# hardware-cfg

Scripts for configuring peripherals that might have bloatware on windows that lets you configure
annoying stuff, such as:

- Lighting,
- Keybindings,
- etc..

The issue is:

1. Linux is the only way,
2. Even if I used windows, I don't want an app to turn off the RGB mania that comes with 
   most gaming peripherals.


As such, this repo has the scripts & configuration stuff needed to configure peripherals on Linux 
-- Bye bye annoying Rainbows.


# Things & Stuff

My mouse is the only thing that has annoyed me enough to do this so far (although the Razer 
keyboard I use when gaming is a strong contender), so that's all that's in here ATM.

If I get round to un-shitification-ing the keyboard too, I'll add scripts/READMEs for what 
I did in this here repo. I would't hold your breath since I use a different keyboard to code...
